# Hi I'm Daniel Siepmann

I try to not depend on external services or companies but prefer FOSS and self hosted solutions.
That's why you won't find much here.
Most things here are for convenience or because I need to fork projects on GitHub in order to contribute.

All my stuff is available at https://git.daniel-siepmann.de/ instead.

Also check out my own English website: https://daniel-siepmann.de/ .
